How It Works
This demo app simulates checking balances of EVM-compatible wallets (like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, etc.). In a real implementation, you would connect to a blockchain explorer's API or use a Web3 provider like Alchemy or Infura.

The core functionality involves:

Storing wallet addresses
Making requests to blockchain nodes
Parsing JSON-RPC responses
Formatting and displaying results
